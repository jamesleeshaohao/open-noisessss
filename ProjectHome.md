A collaborative effort to make better building blocks for free development of artistic and performance tools for music, live performance, and live visualism.

Goals:
  * Timing and sequencing frameworks
  * Connections to sound hardware
  * Support for MIDI, plug-ins
  * OpenSoundControl and device integration and networking
  * Hooks for DSP code and for connection to other synthesis environments (Pd, SuperCollider)
  * Ease of use from within Processing on desktop and mobile

The goal is to build as little as possible, but do as much as possible, relying on native, Java, and Processing pieces for cross-platform support and ease of use.

We'll build these module-by-module, focusing on the block rather than the whole.

Most importantly, we'll have an open lab in which to share projects before they're cleaned up, learn from each other, and exchange ideas.
